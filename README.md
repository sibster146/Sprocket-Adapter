# Sprocket-Adapter
This repo contains 3-D modelling and Computer-aided machining files to build a sprocket adapter via CNC machine.
The 3-D CAD was created with Solidworks, and the Finitie Element Analysis was also done within Solidworks. The CAM was
done using Siemens NX. The final CAM assembly was then imported to the CNC machine, which ultimately built the sprocket
adapter.
